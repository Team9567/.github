# About Team 9567 - Stormbreakers

Stormbreakers is a sibling team to Stormbots, founded in the 2023-2024 season (Crescendo).  Stormbreakers is the introductory team for Freshman and Sophomores, and older students who are new to FIRST Robotics Competitions.

Stormbreakers represents an exciting opportunity for those new to FRC to be fully hands-on with their own robot and take on greater responsibilities than they might otherwise.
